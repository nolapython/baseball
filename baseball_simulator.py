Description: Baseball + Yahtzee: A baseball simulator which uses
two standard dice to simulate the outcomes of a baseball game.
Url: https://github.com/nolapython/baseball

Goals:
1. Find the average number of runs that would be scored in 9 innings.
2. Find the distribution of the number of runs scored across multiple
simulated games.
